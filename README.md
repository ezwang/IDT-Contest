# IDT Contest Submission
Contest submission for TJHSST Team 1

## Installation
You will need a Linux based operating system to install and run this software.
We recommend [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
If you do not want to replace your operating system or dual boot, you can use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to create a virtual machine.
### Automatic Install
To install our solution, simply run the commands:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ezwang/IDT-Contest
$ cd IDT-Contest
$ ./setup.sh
```
The setup script has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Debian 8.3.
Make sure you have the sudo command and Python 2 installed.
You will need root privileges for some parts of the script.
If the script does not work for you, use the manual installation process.
